    "**INTRODUCTION:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I explore how financial characteristics influence bank profitability using regression analysis. The goal is to predict a key performance metric (Net Income) for the four largest U.S. commercial banks (Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo) based on their financial data from 2005 to 2024. By analyzing how variables such as Total Assets, Total Equity, and Total Revenue relate to profitability, this project aims to uncover the patterns that help explain how a bank's size, efficiency, and balance-sheet affect earnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was manually compiled from each bank’s SEC 10-K annual reports, resulting in a consistent panel of financial metrics spanning 20 years. Each record represents a specific bank and year, with features including:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total Assets:** overall resources owned by the bank\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total Equity:** shareholder ownership value\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total Revenue:** total income generated before expenses\n",
    "\n",
    "**Net Income:** final profit after all costs (used here as the target variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "**ROA, ROE, Profit Margin, Asset Turnover, and Equity-to-Assets ratios:** derived indicators of efficiency and leverage\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bank Name and Year:** categorical and temporal features for context\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is a great foundation for a regression problem because it captures continuous financial relationships that evolve. Through this analysis, I aim to build models that can not only estimate profitability but also provide insights into which financial characteristics most strongly drive performance within the banking sector."

    "**REGRESSION AND HOW IT WORKS:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression is a statistical technique used to model and analyze the relationship between a dependent variable (the value we want to predict) and one or more independent variables (the predictors or features). The main purpose of regression is to estimate how changes in the independent variables are associated with changes in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I focus on linear regression, one of the most fundamental and widely used regression methods. Linear regression assumes that the relationship between the dependent variable y and the independent variables x1, x2...xn can be expressed as a straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "                                                ŷ= β0 + β1x1 + β2x2 + ... βnxn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation: \n",
    "\n",
    "**ŷ:** The predicted value of the dependent variables.\n",
    "**β0:** The intercept that represents the predicted value when all of the x's are = to zero.\n",
    "**β1 - βn:** The coefficients which show how much y will change for a one unit change in each of the predictors (x) while holding everything else constant. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model learns these coefficients by minimizing the SSE (Sum of Squared Errors) between the predicted values and actual values. \n",
    "\n",
    "This method finds the line that best fits the data by making these squared differences as small as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once fitted, the model can be used to predict new values of y for whatever x inputs and to interpret the influence of each independent variable. For example, a positive coefficient indicates that an increase in that variable is associated with an increase in the predicted outcome, whereas a negative coefficient suggests the opposite.\n",
    "\n",
    "                                                 SSE = Summation of (yi - ŷi)^2"

    "**EXPERIMENT 1: DATA-UNDERSTANDING:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before building any regression models, I began by gaining an initial understanding of the dataset to identify trends, patterns, and relationships among the financial variables. The dataset includes annual financial data for the four largest U.S. banks—Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo—from 2005 to 2024. Each record represents one bank in one year, with features such as Total Assets, Total Equity, Total Revenue, Net Income, ROA, ROE, Profit Margin, Asset Turnover, and Equity-to-Assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the structure of the data, I first examined summary statistics (mean, median, minimum, and maximum) to check for outliers and to see how each feature is distributed. Then I created visualizations to explore the relationships among variables and identify potential multicollinearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pairplot / scatterplots:** used to visualize how Total Assets, Total Revenue, and Net Income move together across different years.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correlation heatmap:** revealed that Total Assets, Total Revenue, and Total Equity were all highly correlated, suggesting that banks with larger asset bases also tend to generate higher revenue and profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line plots over time:** helped visualize growth trends from 2005 to 2024 and highlighted economic downturns (such as 2008–2009 and 2020), where profitability dropped significantly across all banks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Boxplots grouped by bank:** provided insight into how each bank differs in size and profitability distributions over the 20-year period.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this initial exploration, I observed that the dataset shows strong linear relationships among the major financial metrics, making it a suitable candidate for linear regression modeling. However, the high correlation between certain features indicated a need to watch for multicollinearity, which could affect coefficient interpretability in any of my other experiments."

    "**EXPERIMENT 1: PRE-PROCESSING:**\n",
    "\n",
    "After gaining an initial understanding of the data, I moved on to the preprocessing stage to prepare the dataset for regression modeling. The goal of this step was to ensure data quality, consistency, and appropriate variable formats for numerical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I checked for missing or null values across all columns. Because the dataset was manually compiled from SEC 10-K filings, there were a few missing entries for earlier years in certain banks. These were handled either by forward-filling from nearby years (if a missing value fell within a continuous financial trend) or by removing that record if it lacked several key variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I verified data types. Most features were numeric, but the two columns required adjustments:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bank Name:** converted from text to categorical dummy variables so that each bank could be represented numerically in the regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Year:** kept as a numeric variable to allow trend capture over time if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first experiment, I selected a small group of core financial predictors to keep the model simple and interpretable:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Total Assets*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Total Equity*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Total Revenue*\n",
    "\n",
    "The target variable for prediction was Net Income. These variables were chosen because they represent the fundamental components of a bank’s financial structure—size, capital strength, and earnings capacity—which logically relate to profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before fitting the model, I also applied feature scaling using standardization so that each numeric variable had a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This prevents larger-scale variables, such as Total Assets, from dominating smaller-scale ones like Total Equity.\n",
    "\n",
    "No feature engineering was applied at this stage, as the purpose of Experiment 1 was to establish a baseline model using the most direct financial indicators. Later experiments introduce ratio-based features and transformations to test whether they improve performance."

    "*Potential positive impacts:*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transparency & benchmarking:** Interpretable regression can highlight which balance-sheet drivers (e.g., revenue vs. leverage) most influence profits, improving stakeholder understanding and internal decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Risk awareness:** If profitability is found to depend heavily on leverage, that can flag fragility and encourage more conservative funding structures.\n",

    "\n",

    "**Pro-cyclical incentives:** Profit models trained on “good times” can encourage banks to scale up activities that look profitable in booms but amplify losses in downturns (feedback loops).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overreliance on correlation:** A high R^2 may be mistaken for causation, leading to policies or compensation plans that chase spurious drivers of profit.\n",

    "**Multicollinearity & opacity-in-practice:** Even linear models can become hard to interpret when features are highly correlated (e.g., ROA/ROE/margins). Misinterpretation can misguide strategy or supervision.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fairness & societal spillovers:** Decisions optimized for short-term profit can reduce credit availability to vulnerable communities, worsen financial exclusion, or shift costs to taxpayers if losses are socialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model drift:** Banking regimes change (accounting rules, interest-rate cycles, capital standards). A model that performs well on 2005–2024 may degrade quickly, yielding misleading signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data scope bias:** Using only the Big 4 may limit external validity; their scale and diversification differ from regional banks. Insights could be misapplied to smaller institutions.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Interpretability first:** Prefer transparent features; report standardized coefficients, VIFs for multicollinearity, and partial dependence / coefficient sensitivity to avoid overclaiming.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario & stress testing:** Evaluate models across crisis windows (2008–09, 2020) and rate-hike periods; report performance stability, not just average RMSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Governance & documentation:** Include a concise Model Card: data source, time coverage, assumptions, known limits, monitoring plan, and retraining triggers.\n",

    "**Fairness lens:** Discuss how profit-seeking recommendations might affect access to credit or branch presence; encourage adding community-impact constraints to decisions informed by the model.\n",

    "**CONCLUSION:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this regression project, I learned how data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection each play a critical role in improving predictive accuracy and interpretability. Starting with a simple baseline model using raw financial variables, I saw that while basic relationships existed, the model’s ability to explain profitability was limited. Once I applied preprocessing techniques—handling missing values, standardizing numeric features, and encoding categorical variables—the model became cleaner and more reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Experiment 2, introducing feature engineering had the biggest positive impact. By transforming raw totals into ratio-based measures such as ROA, ROE, and Profit Margin, and applying a logarithmic scale to Total Assets, I captured more meaningful financial relationships and achieved a dramatic performance improvement (RMSE ≈ 1939.84, R^2 ≈ 0.9644). This experiment showed how derived variables can better express efficiency and scale effects than absolute numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Experiment 3, I implemented Ridge Regression to handle multicollinearity and prevent overfitting. Although the R^2 decreased to 0.7347 and the RMSE increased to 5294.27, this model demonstrated the importance of balancing accuracy with stability. Ridge regression produced smaller, more conservative coefficients, making the model more robust and generalizable—an essential quality for financial forecasting where conditions shift over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I learned that the best-performing model on paper is not always the best model in practice. Thoughtful preprocessing and regularization help ensure that predictions remain interpretable, fair, and reliable across changing economic periods. This project strengthened my understanding of how regression techniques connect statistical learning with real-world financial insight, and how each modeling choice influences both performance and ethical application."
